Experimental OpenWhisk asset manager

Setup
=====

This project relies on [Cloudant](https://cloudant.com/) being provisioned somewhere. When this is done, update `dp.json` with your provisioned Cloudant service credentials.

Then run the `install.sh` script to deploy the OpenWhisk actions managing the registry.
